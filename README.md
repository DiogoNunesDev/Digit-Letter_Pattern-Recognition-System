# Pattern-Recognition-System
Explore pattern recognition with this project using the EMNIST dataset. It's a system that processes images of handwritten digits/letters using a deep learning model. It then distinguishes and identifies each character's type and exact identity, showcasing high accuracy in pattern recognition.

Run the "interface.py" file, this file will create an interface where you can submit an image of a letter or digit (preferably with a light background for better performance), then click on the process button to get the predicted letter/digit class.
